    "# CDP Data 2022: Variable Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview  \n",
    "This module extracts specific performance variables from the cleaned CDP dataset to support the greenwashing risk assessment framework. The extraction focuses on self-reported emission data and target information from standardized CDP disclosure sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Variables Extracted\n",
    "- **Reporting periods** (C0.2): Temporal alignment for data consistency\n",
    "- **Target types** (C4.1): Absolute vs. intensity target classification  \n",
    "- **Scope 1 & 2 emissions** (C6.1, C6.3): Core emission data for intensity calculations\n",
    "- **Emission intensities** (C6.10): Revenue-based emission metrics when available\n",
    "- **Target details** (C4.1a, C4.1b): Science-based targets and reduction commitments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Usage Note\n",
    "While this module extracts comprehensive emission and target data, the final analysis uses **only Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions per revenue** for standardized comparison. Other extracted variables (Scope 3, absolute targets, detailed intensity metrics) were initially considered but excluded due to inconsistent calculation methodologies across companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "Structured dataframes containing standardized emission intensity metrics and target information for integration with the performance assessment framework."
